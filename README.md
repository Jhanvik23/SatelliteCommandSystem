# Satellite Command System

## Overview
The Satellite Command System is a Java-based application designed to manage and control various satellite operations. This project demonstrates the implementation of several key software design patterns, including Command, Singleton, and Observer patterns. The system simulates real-world scenarios where commands are issued to satellites, and various actions are performed, such as activating solar panels, checking satellite status, and more.

## Features
- **Command Pattern:** Allows encapsulation of requests as objects, supporting parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging the history of requests.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.
